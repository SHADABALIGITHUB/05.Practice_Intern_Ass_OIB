LEVEL-2 FOR WEB DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGNING

This Repository contains 3 task 

here, I completed Level 2 of the Oasis InfoByte SIP Internship Task 
I chose Level 2 from Web Development and Designing.
contains Three Tasks 
**Task 1:**
         CALCULATOR 
It takes a little skill to create a calculator with basic
mathematical functionalities using CSS, HTML, and
JavaScript. Calculators require an interactive interface to
perform essential functions such as addition, subtraction,
division, and multiplication. It will need a display screen to
display the user’s input and give the results. The grid system
in CSS is for the alignment of buttons on the calculator.
The additional tools you need to build a fully functional
calculator include event listeners, if-else statements,
operators, loops, etc.
 
**Task 2:**
         TRIBUTE PAGE 
With a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, you can easily
create a page for someone you admire. Write about what
you adore in the person, add images, give an appealing
layout, and use paragraphs appropriately. You can also play
around with different font styles and background colors.

**Task 3:**
             A BASIC TO-DO WEB APP

Develop a basic to-do app that enables a user to add daily tasks.
The to-do web app must allow users to add new items to a list, and items
added to a list must be visible. Also, a user can mark a task “complete”
upon its successful completion, and these completed tasks must appear
on a separate list, say Completed Tasks.
You can also add a separate section titled Pending Tasks that will list all
the tasks that require completion. In such a case, the to-do list will be a
union of the Pending Tasks list and the Completed Tasks list. Irrespective
of the list, a user must be able to delete or edit tasks from it.
To further increase the web app's complexity or make it more detailed,
you can add the date and time when a task is added and/or completed.


Here I completed LEVEL 2 Taks All three.
